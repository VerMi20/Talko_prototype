Pymetrics uses a set of ​Flutter plugins​ that enable Flutter apps to use Firebase​
services. You can follow an example that shows how to use these plugins in the
​Firebase for Flutter​ codelab.

Flutter​ is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled
applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter is
used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open
source.

Note ​ : PyMetrics is still under development, and some APIs and platforms might
not be available yet. ​Feedback​ and ​Pull Requests​ are most welcome!
